## Today's Learning: AI-Assisted Game Development

Today I learned to use AI to make games and play them. I successfully created a game called "Flappy Adventure" using Python 3 and leveraged Cursor as my AI-powered development tool to help write the code.

### Key Skills Gained

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Learned how to effectively use AI tools like Cursor to accelerate coding
- **Game Development**: Gained experience in creating interactive games with Python
- **Code Execution**: Mastered the process of running and testing games
- **Problem-Solving**: Developed skills in debugging and iterating on game mechanics
- **Project Organization**: Learned to create new chat sessions and organize old information into files
- **AI Prompting**: Developed skills in instructing AI to use specific Python versions and configurations
- **File Management**: Created separate folders for different games to maintain clean project structure
- **Environment Management**: Set up virtual environments for each game to ensure proper dependency isolation

### Project Details

- **Technology Stack**: Python 3 + Cursor AI
- **Game**: Flappy Adventure
- **Development Approach**: AI-assisted coding workflow

### Organization Creation

I also established an organization called **AAAI** (Antoni and Ariana AI) focused on leveraging AI technology for various applications and learning purposes.

### Future Intentions

I plan to continue exploring and creating new projects with AI assistance. This experience has opened up exciting possibilities for AI-powered development workflows.

### Key Insights

- AI tools can significantly accelerate the development process
- Learning to work effectively with AI requires understanding how to prompt and iterate
- The combination of human creativity and AI assistance creates powerful development capabilities
